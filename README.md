A native PowerShell(5+) cmdlet which can be used to compare the hash values of a list of files, against each other or an expected hash outcome, using various hashing algorithms. 

SHA512 is used by default, but you may specify which algorithm(s) you wish to use.

Compare-FileHash prints the result of each hash for each file (unless '-Quiet' is passed), and if all algorithms' hashes match (or the first, if '-Fast' is passed), it will return 'MATCH'. If any hash does not match, it will return 'MISMATCH'.

## Installation & Setup üîß

[Download](https://github.com/turtlshell/Compare-FileHash/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the zip directly, or [install](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) & use Git from PowerShell:

```
# Clone this repository
PS > git clone https://github.com/turtlshell/Compare-FileHash.git

# CD into the repository directory
PS > cd Compare-FileHash

# (Optional, depending on your security settings) Set execution policy, to allow this script to run
PS > Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

# Import the file
PS > . .\Compare-FileHash.ps1
```
<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage üí°

1. Import the file into your PowerShell session:
```
. .\Compare-FileHash.ps1
```

2. Use the cmdlet (examples):

- Compare SHA512 of two files:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt'
```

- Compare SHA512 of multiple files, suppressing individual hash results:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt','C:\file3.txt' -Quiet
```

- Compare all algorithms' hashes of two files and accept the first hash match, skipping subsequent algorithms:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt' -Fast -Algorithms All
```

- Compare the specified hashing algorithms of two files:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt' -Algorithms SHA1,SHA256,SHA384
```

- Compare a file's MD5 against its expected MD5:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt' -Algorithms MD5 -Expected D41D8CD98F00B204E9800998ECF8427E
```

## Parameters ‚öôÔ∏è

#### -Files (mandatory)

The list of file paths, separated by commas, to compare the hashes of. A minimum of two paths must be supplied (or one, if '-Expected' is passed), however there is no upper limit.

#### -Algorithms (optional)

Determines which algorithm(s) are used to compute the specified files' hashes. You may pass any number of [algorithms](#algorithms), separated by commas. Passing "All" will run all algorithms. When unspecified, SHA512 will be used.

#### -Expected (optional)

Allows you to specify the hash you are expecting, and compares the file(s) against it, rather than against each other. Passing this switch reduces the minimum '-Files' limit from 2 to 1, and limits '-Algorithms' to 1 type.

#### -Quiet (optional)

Suppresses the individual hash values from being printed; only the result, ('MATCH' or 'MISMATCH'), will be printed.

#### -Fast (optional)

Returns 'MATCH' if the first algorithm's hashes match, skipping the calculation of any subsequent hashes.

## Algorithms üßÆ

Compare-FileHash supports all algorithms which are supported by Get-FileHash. As of right now, those are:

- SHA512
- SHA384
- SHA256
- [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Attacks)*
- [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Security)*

See Microsoft's help page on [Get-FileHash](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash#parameters) for more info.

\* Please note that these hashes are considered [insecure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Comparison_of_SHA_functions), and are vulnerable to certain attacks. If you're dealing with something sensitive, consider using SHA256 or above.
