A native PowerShell(5+) cmdlet which can be used to compare the hash values of a list of files, against each other or an expected hash outcome, using various hashing algorithms. 

SHA512 is used by default, but you may specify which algorithm(s) you want to use.

The cmdlet prints the result of each hash for each file (unless the '-Quiet' switch is used), and if all algorithms' hashes match (or if one algorithm's hashes match, using the '-Fast' switch), it will return 'MATCH'. If any hash does not match, it will return 'MISMATCH'.

## Installation & Setup üîß

Download the zip directly, or [install](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) & use Git. From PowerShell:

```
# Clone this repository
PS > git clone https://github.com/turtlshell/Compare-FileHash.git

# CD into the repository directory
PS > cd Compare-FileHash

# (Optional, depending on your security settings) Set execution policy, to allow this script to run
PS > Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

# Import the file
PS > . .\Compare-FileHash.ps1
```
<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage üí°

1. Import the file into your PowerShell session:
```
. .\Compare-FileHash.ps1
```

2. Use the cmdlet (examples):

- Compare SHA512 of two files:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt'
```

- Compare SHA512 of multiple files, suppressing individual hash results:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt','C:\file3.txt' -Quiet
```

- Compare all algorithms' hashes of two files, and return 'MATCH' on the first algorithm match, skipping subsequent algorithms:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt' -Fast -Algorithm All
```

- Compare the specified hashing algorithms of two files:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt','C:\file2.txt' -Algorithm SHA1,SHA256,SHA384
```

- Compare the specified file's MD5 against the specified expected MD5:
```
Compare-FileHash -Files 'C:\file1.txt' -Algorithm MD5 -Expected D41D8CD98F00B204E9800998ECF8427E
```

## Parameters ‚öôÔ∏è

#### -Files (mandatory)

The list of file paths, separated by commas, to compare the hashes of. A minimum of two paths must be supplied, however there is no upper limit.

#### -Algorithm (optional)

Determines which algorithm(s) are used to compute the specified files' hashes. You may pass any number of algorithms, separated by commas, which the Get-FileHash cmdlet supports. Passing "All" will run all algorithms, and if this parameter is not passed, it will default to SHA512.

#### -Expected (optional)

Allows you to specify the hash you are expecting, and compares the file(s) against that, rather than against each other. Passing this switch reduces the minimum '-Files' limit from 2 to 1, and limits '-Algorithm' to 1 type.

#### -Quiet (optional)

Suppresses the individual hash values from being printed; only the final result ('MATCH' or 'MISMATCH') will be printed.

#### -Fast (optional)

Returns 'MATCH' if the first computed algorithm's hashes match. This skips the calculation and comparison of any subsequent algorithm's hashes if they are not needed.

## Algorithms üßÆ

Compare-FileHash supports all algorithms which are supported by the native cmdlet Get-FileHash. As of right now, those are:

- SHA512
- SHA384
- SHA256
- [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Attacks)*
- [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Security)*

See Microsoft's help page on [Get-FileHash](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash#parameters) for more info.

\* Please note that these hashes are considered [insecure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Comparison_of_SHA_functions), and are vulnerable to certain attacks. If you're dealing with something sensitive, consider using SHA256 or above.
